# C-Projects_Misc
Different C++ Projects I created on my own.

best_move.cpp: Program for a friend. Needs to be developed more, but compares two moves with different damage outputs and chances of occurring to see which one is "better" (i.e. which one does the same amount of damage in less time).

linkedlist.cpp: A file that contains insertToList, which allows you to insert nodes into a linked list (which are defined manually using Node and LinkedList structs).

parser.cpp: Takes a string as an input and parses each char into an array, printing out the individual characters afterwards.

pi.cpp: Returns n digits of pi based on user's input of n.

smallest_array.cpp: Returns the smallest value in an array.

smallest_of_four.cpp: Returns the smallest of four integers input by the user.

sumPos_Neg.cpp: Takes as many integers as you would like as inputs and returns the sum of both the positive and negative integers.
